    <div class="balii">
      <p class="paragraph">
        I was 16 when i visited Bali. It was my first international trip.
        It was such an incredible experience and the people, food, culture,
        and everything was so much more amazing than I could even imagined.
        Because of this, I’m super excited to share my first time in Bali
        itinerary with you. In this blog post, I’ll be sharing where to
        stay, places to go, and much more.

      <ul class="paragraph">
        <li><strong>Wifi:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>It&rsquo;s a good idea to purchase pocket wifi online ahead of time</li>
            <li>JR Rail pass sells it online and you can pick it up at airport upon arrival</li>
            <li>If you don&rsquo;t purchase pocket wifi, most trains and certain areas have wifi available</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Bring cash:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>A lot of stores accept cash only so bring an appropriate amount of cash (better to exchange at your bank
              before you go or exchange at the airport when you arrive)</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Apps to commute:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Google Maps &ndash; use for walking distance destinations</li>

      <h2 id="heading2"> Where to stay in Bali </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Bali has, without a doubt, the best range of accommodation in Indonesia,
        from Rp60,000 per night ($6) losmens to US$4,000 per night super-homes. <br>

        <br>The backpackers tend to head for Kuta, which has the cheapest digs on the island.
        However, if the accommodation is located near a night club they can be noisy at
        night. One quiet and clean place in the cheaper category is Hotel Oka in Jalan
        Padma in Legian, only a kilometre from the night clubs of Kuta and walking distance
        from the beach. <br>

        <br>Many of the numerous five-star resorts are clustered in Nusa Dua, Seminyak and Ubud.
        Sanur and Jimbaran offer a fairly happy compromise if you want beaches and some quiet.
        Ubud's hotels and resorts cater to those who prefer spas and cultural pursuits over
        surfing and booze. Legian is situated between Kuta and Seminyak and offers a good
        range of accommodation. The newest area to start offering a wide range of
        accommodation is Uluwatu which now boasts everything from surfer bungalows
        to the opulent Bulgari Hotel. Further north on the west coast is the district
        of Canggu, which offers many traditional villages set among undulating rice
        fields and a good range of accommodation. For rest and revitalisation, visit
        Amed, an area of peaceful fishing villages on the east coast with some good
        hotels and restaurants, or head for the sparsely populated areas of West Bali.

        Places to visit
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Where do I even start? There are actually SO many places to visit and honestly,
        I didn’t get to go to all the places that I wanted to go. For now, I’m going to
        share the places that I visited and list the other places that I had on my mind.

        <br>The Tanah Lot temple was built and has been a part of Balinese mythology for centuries. The temple is one
        of seven sea temples around the Balinese coast. Each of the sea temples was established within eyesight of the

        UBUD BALI
      </h3>
      <img src="Ubud1.jpg" class="collage">
      <p class="paragraph">
        The Ubud Palace, officially Puri Saren Agung, is a historical building complex situated in Ubud, Gianyar Regency
        of Bali, Indonesia. <br>
        <br> The palace was the official residence of the royal family of Ubud. It was on his travels that Rsi Markandya
        received a divine revelation that in Bali he was to bury five precious metals on a mountain slope where the
        mother
        temple of Besakih now stands today. Along with a group of followers, Rsi Markandya was magnetically attracted to
        a
        destination located in the central foothills of the island that radiated light and energy. This place was
        Campuhan
        in Ubud at a junction in the Wos River and it was here that he felt compelled to build a temple by the name of
        Pura
        Gunung Lebah. <br>
        <br> This modest palace and its temple, Puri Saren Agung, share a compound in the heart of Ubud. Most of its
        structures were built after the 1917 earthquake and the local royal family still lives here. You can wander
        around most of the compound and explore the many traditional, though not excessively ornate, buildings. The
        main pavilion often hosts evening dance performances.

      <h3 id="heading2"> Last Thoughts </h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Bali Island is an unrivaled vacation destination. The experiences that we went through made our family closer
        than ever before. The time we spent together, the candid discussion we had on those things that dog our family,
        and being able to forget all the troubles that you go through in everyday life makes it my number one
        destination.
