          <p id="para">
            Bali, the famed Island of the Gods, with its varied
            landscape of hills and mountains, rugged coastlines
            and sandy beaches, lush rice terraces and barren
            volcanic hillsides all providing a picturesque
            backdrop to its colourful, deeply spiritual and
            unique culture, stakes a serious claim to be
            paradise on earth. With world-class surfing and
            diving, a large number of cultural, historical and
            archaeological attractions, and an enormous range
            of accommodations, this is one of the world's most
            popular island destinations and one which
            consistently wins travel awards. Bali has something
            to offer a very Broadway market of visitors from
            young back-packers right through to the rich.

          <h1> Bali Religion and Culture</h1>
          <h2> Religion </h2>
          <p id="para"> Balinese Hinduism is very closely related to the Hinduism in
            Indian history. Their beliefs are based on the Vedic, ancient
            writings, philosophies and various living arrangements with many
            different theories that all support each other. Hinduism came to
            Bali during the arrival of Indian traders. Long before
            Islam, Hinduism became the core beliefs of the people using rituals,
            traditions, and arts. It also brought with it spiritual ideas, myths
            and legends – which can be seen in the unique festivals and events
            associated with the spirits of ancestors and their gods There are more
            than 20,000 temples across the island; each one is associated with a
            specific characteristic such as virtue of descent or geographical area.</p>
          <h2>Culture</h2>
          <p id="para">
            The culture of Bali is one of slow pace, the people are very tolerant
            and welcoming to visitors, however, they are also very modest and
            polite people so dress modestly and behave modestly. Public displays of
            affection are frowned upon in Indonesia, Balinese are more tolerant
            than the mainland of Indonesia but partners kissing and public nudity
            is not acceptable and 60% of tourists to Bali are from the mainland.
            Balinese culture is not to complain and not to get angry in public,
            you may find they giggle if they are uncomfortable if you confront them.

        <h1 id="h"> BEST TIME TO TRAVEL </h1>
        <h3>When is the best time to travel and come to Bali?</h3>
        <p id="para">
          The best time to travel to Bali and enjoy its beaches is from June to
          September, the weather is usually sunny, the heat is not too intense,
          and in any case, it's tempered by the breeze. There are just some brief
          downpours or thunderstorms every now and then, which, however, are more
          likely at night and in the early morning. August is the best month, since
          it is the driest. May and October, too, are months you may want to consider,
          in fact they are the best ones among those that do not fall in the high
          season: they are a bit more muggy and rainy, but they are still out of the
          actual rainy season. However, in inland and mountainous areas, thunderstorms
          are frequent. <br>
          <br>
          Best time to visit Bali depends mainly on the weather also high and low season
          in terms of “school holiday schedules”, which does affect the overall price
          for accommodation and even the number of people you share the island with.
          <br>
          The best time to visit Bali would be during the “shoulder season” months of May,
          June or September. Here are our primary reasons for choosing this time:
          <ul>
            <li>Room prices are not at peak rates (usually 30-50% lower)
            </li>
            <li>Weather is dry and less humid than peak of rainy season
            </li>
            <li>Not too crowded
            </li>
            <li>Good sea conditions for diving/surfing/snorkeling
            </li>
          </ul>
